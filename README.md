### Approach Taken

We decided to make a small wiki page of the How I Met Your Mother show, a classic fan favorite. The search for an existing 3rd party API was long and hard but we managed to find one that had all the episodes and cast members, as well as the roles each played. We knew that we wanted a page for episodes and cast for sure and then expanded onto adding a blog like forum with comments since we didn't want the cast list or episode list to be editted or deleted.
