### Approach Taken

Normally, using React, the front is easy enough to implement. I had to learn Next.js this time, so my start wasn't as speedy and quick as usual. Next.js has its own version of React-Router built in. 

Security is my main focus after the functionality portion. Client information needs to be secure, and only allowed caregivers will be able to view the client details. That will be set up by the Guardian, and guardians additionally should only be able to add and edit their own clients. 

### Technologies Used

* React
* Next.js
* Axios
* Prisma
* Postgres
* Heroku
* Auth0
* Material UI


### creating a user for local database

```
psql
create user postgres with CREATEDB;
alter user postgres with LOGIN;
\password postgres
postgres
postgres
\du
\q
```
### Unsolved Problems
- when fetch gets a 404, the console always logs an error even though i have a catch handler for it

- Added 'postinstall' script because the prisma needed to regenerate the client on every deploy.
